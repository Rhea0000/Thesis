# Thesis
This Github repository is created for the Master thesis project – Creating ontology in the drink water distribution network domain. The author is Rhea Huang and from University of Amsterdam (y1kelinblue@gmail.com). 

The LLM plays an important role in AI development, it offers a great convenience in the Natural Language Processing task such as text summarization. The ontology construction could be considered as time consuming, therefore using LLM for the ontology learning should be explored. This project leverages RAG for ontology learning in the drinking water domain. 

The file parameters encompass all adjustable parameters in the code. Initially, download "Parameters.yaml" followed by "Thesis_code.py". You're not required to execute Parameters.yaml but only the thesis_code. All default parameters reside in parameters.yaml; if adjustments such as queries or inputs are necessary, do so there. 

Next, import all packages and install any required packages if installation fails. Then input your API, whether it's OpenAI, Hugging Face, or another platform compatible with your Language Model (LLM). Subsequently, proceed to run the code either in its entirety or step by step. If an error such as a 500 server error occurs, it might signify that the LLM is unable to process your query. In such cases, either retry or modify the query. 


Below is a flowchart delineating the logic behind the code, while the input document, output document and complete research article are accessible at XX.
