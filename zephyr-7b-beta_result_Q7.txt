This Turtle syntax defines the classes and properties for each input entity, as well as their relationships and attributes. The `:pipe` class represents a pipe in the water distribution network, and it has properties for material, diameter, length, and connection points. The `:reservoir` class represents a water storage facility, and it has properties for storage capacity and location. The `:pumpingStation` class represents a water pumping station, and it has properties for location, operation status, and water source. The `:valve` class represents a valve in the water distribution network, and it has properties for control mechanism, flow rate, position, and connection points. The `:manhole` class represents a manhole in the underground water distribution network, and it has properties for accessibility and location. The `:hydrant` class represents a firefighting connection point device, and it has properties for purpose (firefighting), material (metal or plastic), color (red or yellow), flow rate, location, and owner (fire department). The `:WaterTreatmentPlant` class is not a part of the water distribution network, but it has a property to indicate that it is not a part of the water distribution network. The Turtle syntax also includes a property called `:isNotAPartOfWaterDistributionNetwork`, which has a domain of `:WaterDistributionNetworkPart` and a range of `rdf:boolean`. This property can be used to indicate that an entity is not a part of the water distribution network, which is useful for entities like water treatment plants that are related to the water distribution network but are not physically a part of it.
