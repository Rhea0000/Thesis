This file is created by Rhea Huang (y1klelinblue@gmail.com) for the Master thesis project â€“ creating ontology in the drink water distribution network domain. 
The Large Language Model (LLM) is pivotal in advancing AI, particularly in streamlining tasks within Natural Language Processing, such as text summarization. Given the time-intensive nature of ontology construction, exploring the utilization of LLM for ontology learning is crucial. This document employs RAG for ontology learning within the drinking water domain. It utilizes the OPEN AI EMBEDDING as the embedding model and employs multiple LLMs for experimentation. The query remains consistent across all Large Language Models (LLMs), but slight variations exist in the code to accommodate the correction of answer formats, as each model may yield different responses. The flowchart is available below:

By default, the file executes the model twice, enabling comparison between the text generated by the same model at different times. Moreover, this code can be adapted for ontology learning in alternative domains. By segmenting the document into distinct model chunks and adjusting the input and query specifications to match the domain, one can experiment with specific LLMs for Ontology Learning.
