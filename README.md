# Thesis
This file is designed for the Master thesis project â€“ creating ontology in the drink water distribution network domain. 
The Large Language Model (LLM) is pivotal in advancing AI, particularly in streamlining tasks within Natural Language Processing, such as text summarization. Given the time-intensive nature of ontology construction, exploring the utilization of LLM for ontology learning is crucial. This document employs RAG for ontology learning within the drinking water domain. It utilizes the OPEN AI EMBEDDING as the embedding model and employs multiple LLMs for experimentation.
