The terms of the lexicon associated with a textual description, indicating also possible synonyms; Having produced a first lexicon, users could, in this step, enrich it by associating a textual description with each entry. Users can enrich the lexicon by associating a textual description with each entry. In identifying synonyms it is necessary to pinpoint the \"preferred term\" and label the others as synonyms. You can provide 0 to 2 synonyms for the input entity in the form of a dictionary if available. \n",
    "        Step 3. Taxonomy for input entity. Domain terms organized in a generalization/specialization (ISA) hierarchy; The first is a taxonomy based on the specialization relation, or the ISA relationship connecting a more specific concept to a more general one (such as invoice ISA business document).  Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves. Please provide the taxonomy for the input entity.\n",
    "        Step 4. Predication for input entity. Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP. Please only return CP,AP,RP for the input entity.\"\"\"\n",

To this end, a user would analyze the structure and components an entity exhibits, creating the hierarchy based on the partOf (inverse hasPart) relationship. Parthood can also be applied to immaterial entities (such as a regulation subdivided into sections and articles or a process subdivided into sub-processes and activities). \n",

The terms of the lexicon associated with a textual description, indicating also possible synonyms; Having produced a first lexicon, users could, in this step, enrich it by associating a textual description with each entry.

Domain terms organized in a generalization/specialization (ISA) hierarchy; The first is a taxonomy based on the specialization relation, or the ISA relationship connecting a more specific concept to a more general one (such as invoice ISA business document).  Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves. Please provide the taxonomy for the input entity.\n",
    "        Step 4. Predication for input entity. Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP. Please only return CP,AP,RP for the input entity.\n",

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms.

Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms.

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key.

Parthood can also be applied to immaterial entities (such as a regulation subdivided into sections and articles or a process subdivided into sub-processes and activities). \n",

Domain terms organized in a generalization/specialization (ISA) hierarchy; The first is a taxonomy based on the specialization relation, or the ISA relationship connecting a more specific concept to a more general one (such as invoice ISA business document).  Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves.

    "        Step 4. Predication for input entity. Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves.

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves.

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

The terms of the lexicon associated with a textual description, indicating also possible synonyms; Having produced a first lexicon, users could, in this step, enrich it by associating a textual description with each entry. Users can enrich the lexicon by associating a textual description with each entry. In identifying synonyms it is necessary to pinpoint the \"preferred term\" and label the others as synonyms. You can provide 0 to 2 synonyms for the input entity in the form of a dictionary if available. \n",
    "        Step 3. Taxonomy for input entity. Domain terms organized in a generalization/specialization (ISA) hierarchy; The first is a taxonomy based on the specialization relation, or the ISA relationship connecting a more specific concept to a more general one (such as invoice ISA business document).  Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves. Please provide the taxonomy for the input entity.\n",
    "        Step 4. Predication for input entity. Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP. Please only return CP,AP,RP for the input entity.\n",

    "        Step 2. Domain glossary for input entity. The terms of the lexicon associated with a textual description, indicating also possible synonyms; Having produced a first lexicon, users could, in this step, enrich it by associating a textual description with each entry. Users can enrich the lexicon by associating a textual description with each entry. In identifying synonyms it is necessary to pinpoint the \"preferred term\" and label the others as synonyms. You can provide 0 to 2 synonyms for the input entity in the form of a dictionary if available. \n",
    "        Step 3. Taxonomy for input entity. Domain terms organized in a generalization/specialization (ISA) hierarchy; The first is a taxonomy based on the specialization relation, or the ISA relationship connecting a more specific concept to a more general one (such as invoice ISA business document).  Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves. Please provide the taxonomy for the input entity.\n",
    "        Step 4. Predication for input entity. Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP. Please only return CP,AP,RP for the input entity.\n",

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves. Please provide the taxonomy for the input entity.\n",

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP. Please only return CP,AP,RP for the input entity.\n",

      "This Turtle syntax defines the classes and properties for each input entity, as well as their relationships and attributes. The `:pipe` class represents a pipe in the water distribution network, and it has properties for material, diameter, length, and connection points. The `:reservoir` class represents a water storage facility, and it has properties for storage capacity and location. The `:pumpingStation` class represents a water pumping station, and it has properties for location, operation status, and water source. The `:valve` class represents a valve in the water distribution network, and it has properties for control mechanism, flow rate, position, and connection points. The `:manhole` class represents a manhole in the underground water distribution network, and it has properties for accessibility and location. The `:hydrant` class represents a firefighting connection point device, and it has properties for purpose (firefighting), material (metal or plastic), color (red or yellow), flow rate, location, and owner (fire department). The `:WaterTreatmentPlant` class is not a part of the water distribution network, but it has a property to indicate that it is not a part of the water distribution network. The Turtle syntax also includes a property called `:isNotAPartOfWaterDistributionNetwork`, which has a domain of `:WaterDistributionNetworkPart` and a range of `rdf:boolean`. This property can be used to indicate that an entity is not a part of the water distribution network, which is useful for entities like water treatment plants that are related to the water distribution network but are not physically a part of it.\n",

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms.

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

This property represents the location of the hydrant within the water distribution network. Other possible properties that could be associated with hydrants include characteristics such as size, material, and type of connection.

Hence, we can leave this step empty.\\n\\nStep 4: In this step, we are identifying the properties that characterize the input entity. As the input entity is a pipe that distributes water throughout a water distribution network, we can identify the following properties:\\n\\n- Distribution Network: This is a complex property (CP) that represents the entire water distribution network.

Domain terms organized in a generalization/specialization (ISA) hierarchy; The first is a taxonomy based on the specialization relation, or the ISA relationship connecting a more specific concept to a more general one (such as invoice ISA business document).  Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves. Please provide the taxonomy for the input entity.\n",
    "        Step 4. Predication for input entity. Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP. Please only return CP,AP,RP for the input entity.\n",

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms.

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms.

Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key.

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms.

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.

Users must not only identify ISA relations between existing terms but also introduce more abstract terms or generic concepts seldom used in everyday life but that are extremely useful in organizing knowledge. During this step users thus provide feedback to the two previous knowledge levels—lexicon and glossary—since taxonomy building is also an opportunity to validate the two previous levels and extend them with new terms. Users must find a good balance between the breadth of the taxonomy, or average number of children of intermediate nodes, and its depth, or levels of specialization and the granularity of taxonomy leaves.

Terms representing properties from the glossary identified and connected to the entities they characterize; This step is similar to a database design activity, as it concentrates on the properties that, in the domain at hand, characterize the relevant entities. Users generally identify atomic properties (AP) and complex properties (CP). The former can be seen as printable data fields (such as unit price), and the latter exhibit an internal structure and have components (such as address composed of, say, street, city, postal code, and state). Finally, if a property refers to other entities (such as a customer referred to in an invoice) it is called a reference property (RP). In a relational database, an RP is represented by a foreign key. The resulting predicate hierarchy is organized with the entity at the top, then a property hierarchy below it, where nodes are tagged with CP, AP, and RP.
